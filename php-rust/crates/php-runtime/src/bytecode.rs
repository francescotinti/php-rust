//! Bytecode: the instruction set the VM executes, and the program structures
//! that hold it (VM-migration Fase 2).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Today the runtime *tree-walks* the [`crate::hir`] directly ([`crate::eval`]).
//! That is correct but structurally hostile to suspendable / non-structured
//! control flow: generators ride a stackful `corosensei` coroutine plus an
//! `unsafe` `*mut Evaluator` reborrow, and `goto` / `break N` propagate signal
//! enums up the Rust recursion. A flat instruction stream with an explicit
//! instruction pointer makes all of that ordinary: a generator is a frame whose
//! `ip` is parked at a `Yield`, a `goto` is a `Jump`.
//!
//! This module defines only the *instruction set* and the *program* it lives in.
//! The compiler (HIR → bytecode) is `crate::compile`; the dispatch loop and the
//! runtime frame (`ip` + operand stack + slots) are `crate::vm`.
//!
//! # Execution model: stack-based, slot-addressed locals
//!
//! The VM is a **stack machine** for expression evaluation, with **named locals
//! addressed by [`Slot`]** (the resolution the HIR already did — see
//! [`crate::hir::Program::slots`] / [`crate::hir::FnDecl::slots`]). This is the
//! CPython/JVM shape, deliberately *not* a register-allocated machine:
//!
//! - it makes the compiler a trivial post-order emit (no temporary-register
//!   allocator), so getting to behavioural parity with the tree-walker is fast
//!   and low-risk — the priority for the migration;
//! - it makes a generator a single saveable thing: park `ip`, keep `slots` and
//!   the operand `stack`, resume later. One coroutine, no native stack, no
//!   `unsafe`.
//!
//! Register allocation (collapsing the operand stack into flat registers à la
//! Lua/Zend) is a *later* optimisation that can be layered on without changing
//! this contract.
//!
//! ## Stack discipline (the invariant the compiler must uphold)
//!
//! - **Every compiled expression leaves exactly one value on the operand stack.**
//! - **Every compiled statement leaves the stack at the depth it found it.**
//!   (An expression-statement therefore compiles to `<expr>` followed by [`Op::Pop`].)
//!
//! Value semantics (arithmetic, comparison, type juggling, string conversion)
//! are *not* re-implemented here: the VM delegates [`Op::Binary`] / [`Op::Unary`]
//! / [`Op::Cast`] to `php_types::ops` / `php_types::convert`, exactly as the
//! tree-walker does. The bytecode only encodes *control* and *data movement*.
//!
//! # Scope of this first cut (Tier 1)
//!
//! The opcodes below cover the tree-walker's Tier-1 surface: echo/print,
//! literals, local read/write, compound and inc/dec assignment to a bare slot,
//! the binary/unary/cast operators, structured control flow (if / while /
//! do-while / for / ternary / short-circuit `&&` `||`, and `break N` /
//! `continue N`, all lowered to [`Op::Jump`] families at compile time), and
//! `return`. Everything else in the HIR maps to opcodes added as coverage is
//! ported — see [the extension map](#extension-map) — so this enum is expected
//! to grow; it is intentionally non-exhaustive of PHP today.
//!
//! ## Extension map
//!
//! HIR construct → planned opcode(s), added when that coverage is ported:
//!
//! - references (`$a = &$b`, by-ref params, `foreach &$v`) → slot/element
//!   reference fetch + alias ops (the `Zval::Ref(Rc<RefCell<_>>)` cell is reused
//!   verbatim from `php-types`);
//! - arrays / `Place` chains (`$a[k]`, `$o->p`, `$a[] = …`) → `NewArray`,
//!   `FetchDim` / `FetchProp` (read and write/append flavours), `WriteBack`;
//! - `??` / `??=` / `isset` / `empty` → null-aware peek-and-jump + a non-warning
//!   slot/place read;
//! - calls (`Call` / `CallDynamic` / `MethodCall` / `StaticCall` / `New`) →
//!   `Call*` ops with an argument-passing convention over the operand stack;
//! - closures / first-class callables → `MakeClosure(fn_idx)`;
//! - `match` / `switch` → jump tables built at compile time;
//! - `try`/`catch`/`finally`, `throw` → an exception-handler table per `Func`
//!   plus `Throw`;
//! - generators (`yield`, `yield from`) → `Yield` / `YieldFrom`, the payoff that
//!   retires `corosensei`;
//! - classes/enums/static props/consts → method bodies compile to [`Func`]s; the
//!   class metadata stays in the HIR [`ClassDecl`] table the VM consults.
